    # Variables:
    # - File Variables
    #   Use an exclamation mark `!` to negate a variable.
    #   Example: `!$test` matches any file that is not a go test file.
    #
    #   `$all` - matches all go files
    #   `$test` - matches all go test files
    #
    # - Package Variables
    #
    #   `$gostd` - matches all of go's standard library (Pulled from `GOROOT`)
    #
    # Default (applies if no custom rules are defined): Only allow $gostd in all files.

      # Name of a rule.
      main:
